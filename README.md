# MyReads - Project 1 Udacity Nanodegree 

Example app fot udacity's React nanodegree, lesson 1.

This app let you manage your books in three different categories, "Currentyle reading", "Want to read" and "Read". Books can be searched from udacity BooksAPI and add to your own shelf!

## Quickstart

1. Clone this repository
2. Make sure you have the NodeJs latest version installed.
3. Execute "npm install" from app directory to install all depencies
3. Execute "npm start" from app directory to run the app!


## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
